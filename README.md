## **Overview**  
**ELSA** represents ongoing efforts to support Planetary Data System (PDS) data providers in preparing datasets for submission to the Atmospheres Node for archiving. This project integrates multiple facets, including:  
- Embracing the philosophies of archiving with the PDS.  
- Utilizing the PDS4 Archiving Standard for metadata and label creation.  
- Leveraging interactive online environments to interface data providers with the Atmospheres Node seamlessly.  

At its core, **ELSA** facilitates the construction of viable **PDS4 label templates** for use in archive bundles. Using a *‘top-down’ approach*, ELSA auto-populates XML label templates with bundle-specific information entered through an intuitive, online query system.  

This approach takes advantage of Atmospheres Node expertise to ensure all connections between the standard PDS4 hierarchies are accurate. Metadata (both complete and partial) is inherited between labels, while conditional options are dynamically queried from the user, ensuring a streamlined and efficient label creation process.
